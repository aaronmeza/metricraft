Executive Summary
Metricraft’s ClickUp–Cloudflare–ChatGPT Integration will enable seamless, AI-assisted task management by bridging ChatGPT with ClickUp through a Cloudflare-based API layer. We design a Cloudflare Workers application that exposes a safe, normalized REST API for ChatGPT to read and write ClickUp tasks from two specific lists (“Open Loops — metricraft” and “Product Pipeline”). All ChatGPT-initiated writes are mediated via human confirmation, ensuring no unintended changes. The integration emphasizes security (short-lived signed URLs, HMAC signatures, Cloudflare Access authentication) and performance (edge caching via Workers KV, Durable Objects for coordination, and Queues for webhook and bulk task processing). The result is a low-ops, Cloudflare-first solution that can later be generalized into a product or ChatGPT Connector. Key features include:

 with graceful backoff and caching.
Cloudflare Integration Layer: A TypeScript Cloudflare Worker acts as the API gateway, verifying signed requests from ChatGPT and fetching data from ClickUp. Workers KV provides a 90-second cache for read-mostly endpoints to minimize API calls, with Durable Objects ensuring cache coherence and rate-limit coordination across the globe. Cloudflare Queues are used to ingest ClickUp webhooks and handle bulk operations asynchronously, improving reliability.
Security & Access Control: All ChatGPT-triggered GET requests use time-limited HMAC-signed URLs (TTL 1–5 minutes) instead of embedding any long-lived credentials
developers.cloudflare.com
. Write requests by default only return a confirmation URL (protected by Cloudflare Access Google SSO) that a human must click to execute the action. This guarantees human-in-the-loop oversight. Optionally, an HMAC-signed pre-authorized mode can allow trusted bulk writes (e.g. imports) with short expiration and strict payload allow-lists. All write operations are limited to the two designated lists by policy.
Normalized API & AI-Friendly Schema: The integration presents a cleaned, consistent JSON schema for tasks, lists, and comments – e.g., converting ClickUp’s internal terms to friendly names (using “workspace” for what ClickUp’s API v2 calls “team”
developer.clickup.com
developer.clickup.com
), flattening custom field values (resolving dropdown option IDs to labels in responses), and filtering to relevant fields. Endpoints like GET /v1/open-loops or GET /v1/tasks?list=product-pipeline return concise task objects ready for LLM consumption, and POST /v1/task accepts natural parameters (assignee emails, status names, etc.), abstracting away IDs where possible. This layer frees ChatGPT from needing to know ClickUp’s complexities or IDs.
Collaboration Workflow Automation: With this system, ChatGPT can assist in daily workflows. For example, each morning it can call a signed URL to fetch the top open “loops” tasks and generate a summary with next steps; when a user agrees to complete a task, ChatGPT provides a one-click “Mark as Done” confirmation link updating status and adding a verification comment. New product ideas can be “quick added” to the Product Pipeline by drafting in ChatGPT, which then returns a confirmation link to create a pre-formatted task. Bulk task imports (from CSV/JSONL) are handled via an Access-controlled upload page that uses the Worker API (enqueuing tasks for creation and allowing ChatGPT to poll the job status). All these flows are documented in a playbook for our team to immediately use in ChatGPT, increasing productivity without sacrificing control.
Outcome: We deliver a ready-to-deploy Cloudflare Workers project (with OpenAPI spec and a Postman collection) and a minimal Cloudflare Pages UI for confirmations and admin tools. The integration is engineered with productization in mind – modular code, secure defaults, and scalability to multiple workspaces. We compare three productization paths: (A) private Worker API (our immediate solution), (B) an official ChatGPT Connector using OpenAI’s tool plugin interface, and (C) a hybrid where our Worker remains the source of truth and a thin connector layer provides ChatGPT-specific packaging. We recommend starting with the Worker-only approach for full control now, while designing the system such that an MCP (Multi-tenant Connector Platform) facade can be added with minimal changes. This approach gets us immediate value (a custom AI teammate for Metricraft in ClickUp) and a clear route to a potential open-source product/connector in the near future.
Detailed Design: Cloudflare-Based API Layer
Our integration consists of several Cloudflare components working together to mediate between ChatGPT and the ClickUp API. The design goals are to make it LLM-safe (never exposing sensitive tokens or allowing unintended writes), low-latency for reads (through caching and edge execution), and low-ops to maintain (leveraging Cloudflare’s serverless infrastructure). Below we break down the major design points:
ClickUp API Integration
Authentication: In v0, we will use a single ClickUp personal API token (for Metricraft’s workspace) stored as an encrypted Workers Secret. This token (prefixed pk_) authenticates all ClickUp API calls via an Authorization header
developer.clickup.com
. Personal tokens do not expire
developer.clickup.com
, simplifying initial setup. As we move to a multi-tenant or public integration, we’ll transition to an OAuth 2.0 flow where each user installs an OAuth app to grant our integration a workspace token
developer.clickup.com
developer.clickup.com
. (Notably, ClickUp’s OAuth uses a single broad scope – there are no granular scopes to request
docs.nango.dev
 – so an authorized OAuth token grants access to the user’s chosen Workspaces. We will treat those tokens with equal care and implement token storage/rotation if needed.) We will design the code to abstract auth, making it easy to swap the personal token for an OAuth token per user in future.
API Rate Limits: The ClickUp API allows 100 requests per minute per token on our Unlimited plan
developer.clickup.com
. While this is ample for our initial usage, our Worker will include rate-limit handling. We’ll track request counts and employ jittered exponential backoff on HTTP 429 responses. The Worker will inspect ClickUp’s X-RateLimit-Remaining and X-RateLimit-Reset headers to dynamically adjust, if provided
developer.clickup.com
. To further reduce load, read requests are cached (see caching below). The design uses a Cloudflare Durable Object as a central rate limiter – each incoming request can be funneled (if needed) through the DO to ensure we don’t exceed ~1.67 requests/sec sustained. For example, if ChatGPT triggers a burst of reads, the DO can serialize or slightly delay some requests. This avoids hitting the hard limit and provides backpressure that still leverages edge speed for normal operation.
Supported ClickUp Operations: The integration will support core operations needed for our workflows:
Get Tasks: Retrieving tasks (by list or search criteria) with support for filters like status, updated_since timestamps, etc. The Worker will call ClickUp’s List Tasks or Team filter endpoints as needed (e.g., GET /api/v2/list/{list_id}/task with query params, or use the search API if available). The response will be transformed into our normalized schema (see below).
Create/Update Task: Create tasks via POST /api/v2/list/{list_id}/task and update via PUT /api/v2/task/{task_id} for fields like status, name, etc. (ClickUp’s Update Task endpoint does not support updating custom fields
developer.clickup.com
, so custom field changes require separate calls to the Set Custom Field endpoint – our Worker will handle this under the hood to present a unified update).
Comments: Add comments to tasks via POST /api/v2/task/{task_id}/comment. Our API exposes this as a simple POST /v1/task/{id}/comment that ChatGPT can use to log updates or notes on a task. Reading comments is supported via expansions in GET /v1/task/{id}?expand=comments.
Custom Fields: We fully handle custom fields by first discovering them per list and mapping their IDs. ClickUp’s custom fields are list-specific; we’ll use ClickUp’s “Get Accessible Custom Fields” endpoint to list all fields on our two target lists. This allows the Worker to maintain a map of {field_name -> field_id} and, for dropdown fields, {field_id -> {option_id -> option_label}}. When reading tasks, the Worker will replace dropdown IDs with human labels for clarity. When writing, the custom object in our API allows using either the option label or ID; the Worker will look up the appropriate ID (for dropdowns, etc.) to send to ClickUp. (For example, if there’s a custom dropdown “Priority Level” with an option “High”, our API could accept custom: {"Priority Level": "High"} and translate it to field_id: ..., value: option_123_id in the ClickUp request, since the ClickUp API requires the option’s ID
developer.clickup.com
).
Tags: Tags can be added/removed via separate endpoints in ClickUp (Add Tag to Task), but in our create task endpoint we’ll allow a tags array of strings. The Worker will ensure those tags exist in the workspace (creating them via the Space Tags API if necessary) and attach them. Similarly, updating tags can be done via a specific endpoint if needed.
Task Status: Our integration normalizes status handling. The user or ChatGPT can use the status name (e.g., “Done” or “In Progress”) and our logic will map it to ClickUp’s status ID or verify it’s valid for the target list. We also expose an endpoint to fetch allowed statuses if needed (not explicitly requested in the brief, but useful).
Task Hierarchy: Although not a primary focus, we handle basic parent-subtask relationships (ensuring subtasks can be created by specifying a parent task ID in create). Subtasks appear in expansions if expand=subtasks is used on a GET task.
Terminology Normalization: The Worker abstracts differences in terminology. Notably, a ClickUp “Team” in API v2 is the same as a Workspace
developer.clickup.com
developer.clickup.com
; our API will consistently use “workspace” and hide the need for a team_id from the client. Similarly, certain fields (like task “Owners” vs “Assignees”) are normalized (ClickUp uses assignees array; we might accept a single assignee name or email for convenience and look up the user ID via a cached workspace members list).
Search: We provide a GET /v1/search?q=... that uses ClickUp’s search API or a filtered task endpoint. This allows ChatGPT to find tasks by keyword. We scope searches to our Workspace (and potentially to relevant spaces/folders to avoid noise).
Webhooks: We will subscribe to ClickUp webhooks on the relevant lists to keep caches updated and enable event-driven actions. For instance, a webhook on the “Product Pipeline” list for taskUpdated and taskCommentPosted can trigger our Worker to invalidate the cache for that task or to notify ChatGPT of changes (future enhancement). Webhooks in ClickUp can be scoped at the List level
developer.clickup.com
; we will create webhooks for each of the two key lists (and possibly a Space-level webhook for broader events if needed). Each webhook will subscribe to relevant events (task created/updated/deleted, comment posted, status changed, etc.
developer.clickup.com
developer.clickup.com
). ClickUp’s webhook delivery will be directed to a special endpoint on our Worker (e.g., /v1/webhook/clickup). Cloudflare Queues come into play here (see below) to handle these without dropping events. Security: When registering the webhook, we get a secret token from ClickUp that will be used to sign all webhook payloads
developer.clickup.com
. Our webhook handler will verify the X-ClickUp-Signature using HMAC SHA256 as per ClickUp’s docs
developer.clickup.com
 to ensure authenticity. We’ll also use the recommended idempotency key (webhook_id:history_item_id) on each event to prevent double-processing if ClickUp retries the webhook
developer.clickup.com
. Webhooks are tied to the user token that created them
developer.clickup.com
, so in production we’ll need to recreate them if using a different token or if the user (our account) is ever deactivated. The runbook covers periodic verification of webhook health.
Cloudflare Worker Architecture
Our Cloudflare Worker (written in TypeScript) is the heart of the integration, acting as a secure middleware between ChatGPT (or the user) and ClickUp. Key architectural decisions and components include:
Entrypoint & Routing: We implement the Worker as a single fetch event listener (no heavy framework needed), using a lightweight router (we might use the minimalist Hono library for convenience, or just manual URL.pathname checks given the few endpoints). Each API route (/v1/...) is handled by a function that coordinates cache lookup, ClickUp API calls, and response formatting. By keeping logic modular (in files like clickup.ts for API calls and routes.ts for handlers), we ensure maintainability.
Data Caching (Workers KV): To reduce latency and API usage, read requests will leverage Workers KV as a distributed cache. For example, when ChatGPT requests the open loops (GET /v1/open-loops), the Worker will first check KV for a cached JSON payload for that query. We use a composite key strategy: e.g., tasks:list_{open_loops_listId}:status!=done:limit=7 for the query results. Cached items have a short TTL (e.g. 90 seconds) so that active work is fresh but repetitive requests within a short window (like multiple ChatGPT follow-ups) don’t repeatedly call ClickUp. The cache is actively invalidated via webhooks: when a relevant webhook arrives (e.g., a task was updated or new task added), our logic will delete or update the cache entries for that task or list. We also honor any ETag/Last-Modified headers from ClickUp if available (though ClickUp’s API doesn’t clearly provide ETags, it does return date_updated on tasks – we can use that for conditional caching). If ChatGPT or the user asks for data with If-Modified-Since (not typical in ChatGPT context), we could support it by returning 304 if our KV cache indicates nothing changed.
Durable Object (DO) – Cache Coordinator & Rate Limiter: We deploy a Durable Object (e.g., CacheCoordinatorDO) to serve two main purposes:
Global Cache Invalidation: When a write occurs (through our API) or a webhook event is received, the DO acts as a single consistent point to update caches. For instance, if a task’s status changed to Done, the DO will receive that event and purge the cached entry for /open-loops list tasks (ensuring that on the next read, the Worker fetches fresh data from ClickUp). The DO can either directly delete KV keys (using its own KV binding or via the Workers API) or keep an in-memory mapping of “version” for each list that workers check. We’ll use a simple approach: a KV value like cache_version_open_loops that is bumped on every change, and include that version in cache keys. The DO would update those versions and thus effectively invalidate old keys. This avoids needing to list and delete multiple keys on every update.
Rate Limit & Sequentialize Critical Sections: The DO also helps coordinate sequential operations that shouldn’t run in parallel. For example, if two requests try to create the same task (with the same idempotency key) at almost the same time on different global POPs, the DO can ensure only one goes through (the second sees the idempotent result). It can also keep a counter of requests in the current minute for our ClickUp token and hold or reject new ones if we’re at risk of 429 errors (though this is unlikely with caching and moderate use, it’s a safety net). Because DOs provide strong consistency and single-threaded execution, they’re ideal for these scenarios where we need a single global coordinator.
Cloudflare Queues – Webhooks & Bulk Jobs: We use Queues to decouple incoming events and long-running tasks from the user-facing API responses:
Webhook Ingestion: Instead of processing a ClickUp webhook fully in the request handler (which might be retried or could have spikes), the Worker’s webhook endpoint will enqueue the event to a Cloudflare Queue (e.g., clickup-events). A separate Queue Consumer Worker will receive events from this queue. This consumer (which can be a small function in the same codebase, deployed as a Queue-bound Worker) will verify the signature, parse the event, and then perform actions like cache invalidation (via the DO) or logging. Queues ensure that if our Worker was briefly overwhelmed or down, events would queue up and retry with backoff. We can also have a Dead Letter Queue for events that fail processing repeatedly, alerting us for manual intervention (so we never silently lose an update).
Bulk Task Import: Similarly, when the user uploads a CSV or JSON Lines file via our Pages UI, the file is parsed client-side or in the Page and individual task payloads are sent to a POST /v1/tasks/bulk. The Worker will validate the batch (ensuring it doesn’t exceed our limit, e.g., 200 tasks per batch) and then enqueue the tasks to a bulk-import Queue in chunks (maybe 50 tasks per queue message for manageability). A Queue Consumer will then create tasks one by one (or in parallel with respect to ClickUp’s rate limit) and accumulate results. The user (or ChatGPT) can poll GET /v1/import/{job_id} which the Worker will answer by checking a status object (maybe stored in KV or updated in DO) to report how many succeeded/failed. This queue-based design keeps the Worker responses snappy (the bulk request returns immediately with a job ID and does the heavy lifting asynchronously).
Cloudflare Access Integration: All confirmation flows and admin pages are protected by Cloudflare Access (Zero Trust). We set up an Access Policy such that any request to our Worker endpoints that require human confirmation (e.g. /v1/task/confirm?... or the Pages site URLs like /confirm or /upload) must include a valid Cloudflare Access JWT. Our organization uses Google Workspace as the SSO, so we configure Cloudflare Access with Google as the IdP; only specific Google accounts (our team) have Access. The Worker will verify the Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion header on such requests
developers.cloudflare.com
. Cloudflare provides a public JWT signing key per team; we will cache and periodically update this for verifying the JWT’s signature and claims. If the JWT is missing or invalid, the Worker returns a 302 redirect to the Access login, so the user is prompted to authenticate. Once logged in, the user can proceed to the confirm page. This ensures only authorized humans can trigger writes, and no ChatGPT or external entity can bypass this by hitting the endpoint directly.
Secrets Management and Configuration: Our Worker will use environment bindings for all secrets and config data. This includes:
CLICKUP_TOKEN (the personal API token or an OAuth token in future) stored as a Secret Text in Cloudflare KV or environment secret, not in code.
WEBHOOK_SECRET for each ClickUp webhook (if multiple) – these could be stored in KV at registration time and looked up to verify signatures.
HMAC signing keys for our signed URLs (see Security Model below) – likely we use a SIGNING_KEY (and support key rotation by having an array of keys with IDs). These too are kept in Secrets.
The list IDs or other constants for “Open Loops” and “Product Pipeline” lists. We will store these as environment variables (since they’re effectively constants in our integration). Alternatively, the Worker might look them up by name via the ClickUp API at startup, but since names can clash, we’ll use IDs for reliability.
Wrangler’s wrangler.toml (or wrangler.jsonc in newer versions) will define bindings for KV (e.g., CACHE_KV), DO namespaces (for coordinator DO), Queue names, and the Access JWT audience tag (the expected AUD in tokens).
We will document a secret rotation process: e.g., to rotate the ClickUp token, update it in Cloudflare Secrets and optionally trigger a redeploy or DO message to update any in-memory caches; to rotate signing keys, we can introduce a new key in secrets and mark the old as secondary until all issued URLs expire, then remove it.
Observability & Logging: Every request and important event in the Worker will be logged (using console.log with JSON structures that can be aggregated in Workers analytics or exported). We attach a unique request ID to each incoming request (maybe using Cloudflare’s cf.traceId or a custom UUID) and include it in all logs for traceability. The system will classify errors into categories with clear messages, which is crucial for ChatGPT: for example, if a request fails because a task wasn’t found or a field was invalid, the API returns a structured error like { "error": "TaskNotFound", "message": "No task with ID xyz in list", ... }. This helps ChatGPT decide how to respond (maybe ask the user for clarification or handle the error gracefully). We also plan to monitor execution metrics via Cloudflare (the DO can keep counters of how many tasks created, etc., and we can fetch those via a special admin endpoint or using Cloudflare Analytics/GraphQL).
The following diagram outlines the architecture and data flow:
ChatGPT (LLM) --[Signed HTTPS]--> Cloudflare Worker (Edge API)
   ↳ (if GET) Worker checks KV cache -> returns JSON to ChatGPT
   ↳ (if POST) Worker returns confirm_url (Pages site) -> User clicks
User Browser --[Access JWT]--> Cloudflare Pages (Confirm UI) --→ Worker writes to ClickUp
ClickUp API --[Webhooks]--> Cloudflare Worker (webhook endpoint) --→ Queue -> DO -> KV purge
(In the diagram: ChatGPT interacts only via signed URL requests (reads) or receives confirm links (for writes). The actual writes to ClickUp occur only after a user confirmation through the Access-gated page. Webhooks from ClickUp flow back into our system to keep it in sync.)
Security Model and Safeguards
Security is paramount since we’re connecting an LLM to a live project management system. Our model implements multiple layers of protection:
HMAC-Signed URLs for Read Access: We never expose the ClickUp API token to the LLM. Instead, when ChatGPT needs to retrieve data (e.g., “fetch the latest open tasks”), it will use a pre-signed URL that our Worker can verify. These URLs include query parameters: e.g. exp=1693490000 (an expiration timestamp), kid=primary (key identifier), and sig=... (the signature). The signature is HMAC_SHA256(secret_key, string_to_sign). The string_to_sign can be constructed from the request path, query, and exp. For example, to sign /v1/open-loops?limit=7&status!=done, the Worker’s signing utility uses a secret key only it knows to generate a signature. ChatGPT, in its answer, will output the full URL with signature to trigger the tool. When the Worker receives a request, it verifies that:
exp is in the future (and not too far – we limit TTL to maybe 60–300 seconds as specified).
sig matches the HMAC of the request path+params under one of the allowed keys.
The requested operation is allowed (the signature itself encodes the path and critical params to prevent tampering; any mismatch invalidates the sig). We allow-list which endpoints and query parameters can be signed for the LLM. For instance, the LLM might only get signatures for read-only GET endpoints and perhaps certain safe POSTs (like posting a comment could be optionally allowed if we decided, but initially we require confirmation for all writes).
The kid identifies which secret was used so we can support key rotation (the Worker can maintain multiple HMAC secrets, e.g., current and next). We’ll rotate the signing secret periodically and certainly if it’s suspected to leak (the secrets themselves never leave the Worker, and the URLs expire quickly).
This approach means even if the LLM outputs a URL, it’s useless after a few minutes and only valid for the exact request it was intended. If an attacker somehow saw the URL, they couldn’t modify it (signature would fail) nor reuse it later (expiration would pass). This mitigates replay or misuse of read endpoints.
Write Operations – Confirmation Flow: By default, LLM-initiated writes require a human in the loop. Whenever ChatGPT wants to perform an action like “create a task” or “mark tasks as verified,” the Worker will not immediately do it. Instead, the POST /v1/task (or similar) will return a payload such as { "confirm_url": "https://ourapp.example/confirm?token=XYZ", "preview": { ... } }. ChatGPT will present this to the user, likely saying: “Click [here] to confirm creating the task.” The confirm URL points to a Cloudflare Pages site (or could be the Worker itself serving an HTML page) that is protected by Access login. The page will call our Worker (or contain the token that the Worker can verify) to actually perform the action when the user clicks “Yes, do it.” This two-step dance ensures that no matter how the LLM arrives at a decision, nothing changes in ClickUp unless a human explicitly approves it in their browser. We’ll design the confirm page to show the user a preview of what will happen: e.g., “Task Title: X, Description: Y, List: Product Pipeline, Assignee: Bob. Do you confirm creating this task?” Only on confirmation do we call the ClickUp API to create the task, then show success or error to the user. The confirm page can be very minimal (since only we use it). This mechanism covers all writes: new tasks, status changes, comments, etc., except for certain cases below.
Policy Enforcement and Allowed Actions: The Worker enforces that writes are only allowed on specific lists. Even with confirmation, we gate the allowed list_id or task IDs. For instance, if a malfunctioning prompt tried to delete a task outside the “Open Loops” or “Product Pipeline” scope, the Worker would reject it outright (regardless of confirmation). We maintain an internal allow-list of permissible targets (the two list IDs, and tasks under them). This prevents any scenario where the LLM might attempt to act on other parts of ClickUp it shouldn’t manage.
Optional Pre-Authorized Writes (Bulk Ops): Some operations, like bulk imports or marking many items as done, might be tedious to confirm each individual action. For these, we introduce an optional mode: the user (admin) can obtain a temporary admin signature that authorizes a specific action without further confirmation. For example, an import job initiated by a trusted user through our web UI can include an HMAC-signed payload that the Worker will honor directly. Similarly, if we implement a special endpoint like POST /v1/verify-tasks to mark a set of tasks as done (for the “awaiting verify” sweep), we could protect it by requiring a signed parameter (only obtainable by an authorized Pages interface or via Access login anyway). In essence, this mode is like “batch confirm”: the user still initiates it (and is logged in via Access), but they don’t need to click confirm for each sub-action. The signature (with very short TTL) plus the Access JWT serve as authorization. We will use this carefully and log all such usages.
Idempotency and Replay Prevention: The integration defends against duplicate operations. For any potentially repeating request (especially writes), we encourage/request the caller to provide an Idempotency-Key header or parameter. Our Worker will combine this with the action type to form a unique operation fingerprint and store it in KV for ~24 hours. If the same key is seen again, the Worker will return the saved result (or a specific “duplicate” response) rather than performing the action twice. This is crucial for things like bulk imports (where network retries could otherwise create duplicates) and confirmation links (if the user accidentally clicks twice or refreshes the confirm page). Additionally, for webhooks, as mentioned, we use the provided history_item_id to avoid double-processing
developer.clickup.com
. These measures ensure no unintentional repeated side effects in ClickUp.
Audit Logging: Every write action that does occur will be recorded in an append-only log (likely stored in a KV or Durable Object, or even just Cloudflare log stream). The log entry includes timestamp, the authenticated user (from Access JWT, we can extract their email), the action (e.g., “create task” or “update status”), target (list and task ID if applicable), and a hash of the payload. This provides traceability – we can review later what the AI did, who confirmed it, and reconstruct changes if needed. It’s also useful for debugging, and if we open source, it adds accountability (one could extend it to send these logs to Slack or email for review).
Data Access Security: The Worker only exposes the intended API endpoints. Cloudflare Workers by default have no open inbound ports beyond HTTPS, and our API domain will be separate from any sensitive internal systems. Cloudflare ensures our traffic is encrypted and can enforce WAF rules if needed. We will enable CORS appropriately: ChatGPT’s browser-based tool calls may need to fetch the signed URLs (likely via the official plugin interface or directly via browser context). We’ll set CORS to allow the ChatGPT origin if needed, though since ChatGPT’s connectors likely run server-side or via the plugin mechanism, CORS might not matter. For our Pages, we ensure no sensitive data is embedded client-side except the minimal preview (the actual API token stays on server side).
Preventing LLM Prompt Leaks: We never send the raw ClickUp token or long secrets to ChatGPT. The signed URLs are the only mechanism, and those are ephemeral. If ChatGPT somehow asked the Worker for “what is your ClickUp token?”, it obviously wouldn’t have an endpoint for that. The LLM itself will only see JSON results or confirm URLs, not underlying credentials.
Cloudflare Access JWT Verification: As noted, we verify the Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion on protected routes. Specifically, our Worker will parse the JWT, check its expiration, the audience (it should match our Access Application AUD), and that it’s properly signed by our Cloudflare Access public key
developers.cloudflare.com
. Cloudflare rotates keys regularly (every 6 weeks)
developers.cloudflare.com
, so we’ll build a tiny mechanism to fetch the JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) from our team’s Access certs URL and cache them for JWT validation. We can also use a library or Cloudflare’s example code
developers.cloudflare.com
. If JWT validation fails, respond with 401 or redirect to login. This guarantees only our team members can load the confirm page or trigger sensitive endpoints.
Overall, this security model ensures that ChatGPT can read data freely but safely (only within scope) and can suggest changes but not execute them without us explicitly allowing it. It combines cryptographic protections (HMAC, JWT, TLS), Cloudflare’s Zero Trust Access, and good API design (idempotency, allow-lists) to create a robust shield around our ClickUp workspace.
Normalized API Endpoints and Schema
To keep things LLM-friendly, our integration provides a simplified, consistent REST API that hides the idiosyncrasies of ClickUp. All endpoints are under a versioned prefix /v1/ and return JSON. Below is a summary of key endpoints and their behavior:
GET Endpoints (Read-Only)
GET /v1/open-loops – Fetch tasks from the “Open Loops — metricraft” list. Supports query filters:
?limit=N to limit number of tasks (defaults to 100 or so if not provided).
Filtering by status or other fields, e.g. status!=done to get all tasks not marked done, or status=in-progress|waiting to filter by multiple statuses. Our parser will translate these into ClickUp API queries (status names to status IDs).
Optionally, assignee=XYZ (we can allow filtering by assignee name or ID) or date filters like updated_since=<timestamp> as in other endpoints below.
Response: JSON object with an array of tasks, e.g. { "list": "Open Loops", "tasks": [ {...}, {...} ] }. Each task object is normalized (see “Task Schema” below).
GET /v1/tasks – General task query endpoint. Accepts parameters:
list=<list_name_or_id> – e.g., list=product-pipeline or a UUID. We map friendly names “open-loops” and “product-pipeline” to their IDs internally.
space=<space_name> or folder=<folder_name> – (optional) to broaden or narrow scope.
status=<statuses> – filter as above (OR logic for multiple statuses separated by |, and we allow negation with !).
updated_since=<ISO8601_or_ts> – only include tasks updated after this datetime (for “what changed” queries).
We could also support search=<text> here for simple text search across tasks, but we have a separate search endpoint (below).
Response: similar structure with tasks array. Useful for queries like “tasks in Product Pipeline updated today” etc.
GET /v1/task/{task_id} – Fetch detailed information for a specific task by ID. We also allow using ClickUp’s Custom Task IDs if those are enabled and unique (our integration could detect if tasks have custom IDs and resolve them via an index). Query params:
expand= – a comma-separated list of expansions:
comments to include recent comments on the task (the Worker will call ClickUp’s Get Task Comments and embed them).
subtasks to include any subtasks (Worker will fetch subtasks or use the include_subtasks=true parameter if available).
fields to include custom field values (the default GET task from ClickUp already returns custom fields, but we’ll translate them to a nicer format).
Response: A task object with possibly nested comments array, subtasks array, etc. If not found or not allowed, returns 404 or 403.
GET /v1/search – Search for tasks by keyword. Params:
q=<query> – the search string (e.g. "database migration").
space=<space_name> or other scope limit if needed.
Could accept in=name|description|comments to filter where to search (or just search everything by default).
Behavior: The Worker might call ClickUp’s search API endpoint (which searches across all accessible tasks for the user token). We will filter results to our allow-listed lists to be safe (in case the token has access to more). Alternatively, implement a simpler search by retrieving tasks from our two lists and filtering by keyword (fast enough since those lists are not huge, and we cache them).
Response: Array of matching tasks (in same normalized format). Possibly with a highlight or snippet of context, though not strictly needed for ChatGPT – it can just iterate and find relevant info.
GET /v1/import/schema – Provide metadata about the lists and custom fields, to help with bulk import mapping or LLM’s understanding. Response could include:
Known lists: e.g., { "open-loops": { "id": 123, "name": "Open Loops — metricraft" }, "product-pipeline": { "id": 456, ... } }
Status options per list: e.g., list of statuses and their internal IDs.
Custom fields for each list with their field IDs and possible values (especially for dropdown fields). For example: { "Product Pipeline": { "custom_fields": [ { "name": "Priority", "type": "drop_down", "options": { "High": "option_abcd1234", "Low": "option_efgh5678" } }, ... ] } }. This way the LLM knows what fields and tags are available.
This is mostly for completeness; ChatGPT could query this if it’s planning a large import to ensure it uses correct field names and values.
POST Endpoints (Writes – protected by confirmation or signature):
POST /v1/task – Create a new task in one of the allowed lists.
Request Body: JSON like:
{ 
  "list": "open-loops",               // could also accept list_id
  "title": "Task title",
  "description": "Details of task",
  "assignees": ["[email protected]"],   // or user names/IDs; multiple allowed
  "status": "to do",                  // optional, default to list’s default status
  "priority": "High",                // or 1/2/3/4 mapping urgent->low
  "due_date": "2025-09-01T17:00:00Z", // or epoch millis
  "tags": ["Customer", "Urgent"],    // optional tags
  "custom": {                        // any custom fields to set
     "Estimate": 5,
     "Target Release": "Q4 2025",
     "Some Dropdown": "Option 1"
  },
  "idempotency_key": "xyz-123"       // optional; if provided, ensures no duplicate task if retried
}
The Worker will validate and normalize this input: e.g., verify the list is one of the allowed ones (or a matching ID), map assignee emails to ClickUp user IDs (we’ll have a cached team member list from ClickUp’s “Get Workspace Members” API), map status name to status ID for that list, map priority name to priority level number, translate tag names to tag IDs (creating tags in ClickUp if they don’t exist), and translate custom field keys to field IDs and values (including resolving dropdown labels to option IDs

).
Confirmation Flow: By default, this endpoint does not immediately create the task. It returns:
{
  "confirm_url": "https://<our-domain>/confirm?op=createTask&token=ABCD1234",
  "preview": {
     "list": "Open Loops — metricraft",
     "title": "Task title",
     "assignees": ["Alice"], 
     "status": "To Do",
     "fields_set": {"Estimate": 5, "Target Release": "Q4 2025"},
     "description_excerpt": "Details of task"
  }
}
The preview is a summary for the user (we may truncate description). The token or the whole URL encodes the request securely (perhaps it’s a JWT or a short-lived code stored in KV). When the user clicks confirm, the actual creation is done and a success or failure is displayed.
Pre-Authorized Mode: If the request instead included a valid HMAC signature (and perhaps a flag like "force": true or it’s hitting an alternate endpoint or header indicating pre-auth), the Worker could directly create the task (for instance, for automation or bulk import scenario). In that case, it would respond 201 Created with the new task ID and details. This will only be enabled in controlled scenarios (not for general LLM outputs).
POST /v1/tasks/bulk – Import multiple tasks in one request.
Request: JSON with fields:
list: target list (same rules as above).
items: an array of task objects (could be in the same format as single task creation, minus the list field).
idempotency_group: an identifier for this batch (to prevent enqueuing the same batch twice).
We also allow a simpler form where instead of items, the client provides format and a file (if using multipart, or a text field with CSV/JSONL content). But since our Pages UI will handle uploading, the API endpoint will likely receive a parsed list of items already.
Behavior: The Worker will validate that the number of items doesn’t exceed the max (say 200). It will then split them into smaller chunks (to respect rate limiting) and enqueue the tasks to the queue for processing, as described earlier. It generates a job_id (maybe a UUID) and stores an entry in KV or DO for tracking progress (initialized as pending with count of tasks).
Response: { "job_id": "<id>", "status_url": "/v1/import/<id>" } with a 202 Accepted. No confirm link here because we assume this endpoint is only called from the Access-gated UI (and possibly after the user already confirmed by uploading and submitting).
On the Pages site, once the file is uploaded and this returns, we could have the page poll the status URL, or we could integrate ChatGPT to poll it if the user triggered import via chat.
POST /v1/task/{id}/comment – Add a comment to a task.
Request: { "text": "This is a comment body." }
Behavior: This will be treated similarly to other writes – requiring confirmation by default. However, adding a comment might be low-risk enough that we could allow it directly if coming from a certain context. Initially, we’ll require confirmation (the user might click “Yes, post this comment to task X”).
This endpoint ensures the task {id} is in an allowed list (we can verify via stored mapping of task->list or by calling ClickUp if needed).
On success (after confirmation), it will create the comment via ClickUp API and perhaps return the new comment ID or the updated comment list.
(Optional) POST /v1/tasks/verify – Mark multiple tasks as verified/done. This wasn’t explicitly in the design list, but referenced in workflows. We can implement a convenience endpoint to batch update tasks’ status to “Done” (and perhaps add a standard comment “✅ verified via API”).
Request: { "tasks": [<task_id1>, <task_id2>, ...], "comment": "✅ verified via API" }
Worker will check all tasks belong to Open Loops list and are in “Awaiting Verification” status (for instance). It would then either queue these updates or attempt to do them sequentially. Because this is potentially multiple writes, we would likely treat it like bulk – requiring one confirmation for the batch. The confirm page can list the tasks to be marked done.
Once confirmed, the Worker will loop through each ID: call update task status, then add comment. If many tasks, do a few per second to avoid rate issues (or push to queue).
This saves the user from clicking confirm for each task individually in that scenario. We will include this in our playbook as a supported operation.
Job Status & Admin:
GET /v1/import/{job_id} – As mentioned, returns the status of a bulk import job. E.g. { "status": "processing", "processed": 10, "total": 50, "success": 10, "errors": [] } or if done, "status": "completed", "new_tasks": [ids...]. It might also include error details for failed records (like line numbers or validation errors).
Possibly GET /v1/webhooks for a list of active webhooks or a health check (or this could be part of an admin page).
POST /v1/webhooks/refresh – (admin only) to re-register webhooks if needed (e.g., if we rotated tokens or want to extend to new events).
These endpoints are not for ChatGPT but for maintainers (and require Access).
Normalized Data Schema:
We design the JSON output to be easily understood by both humans and LLM, focusing on clarity over verbosity:
Task Object: When the Worker returns a task or list of tasks, each task has fields:
id: the ClickUp task ID (we use the short task ID string).
name: the task title.
status: the status name (e.g., “To Do”, “In Progress”). We use the human-readable status, not the ID.
list: the list name (e.g., “Open Loops”) and maybe an ID if needed (but since our integration deals with two lists, name is fine; for generalization, we include list_id too).
assignees: an array of assignee names or emails. (We could include an assignee_ids as well but not necessary for LLM usage – names are clearer. If multiple, list them all.)
due_date: a timestamp in ISO 8601 (or null if none). We’ll output in a consistent UTC format.
priority: if set, one of “Urgent/High/Normal/Low”.
tags: list of tag names attached to the task.
custom_fields: an object mapping field names to values. For example: "custom_fields": { "Estimate": 5, "Target Release": "Q4 2025", "Customer": "Acme Corp" }. For dropdowns, we put the label (e.g., if internally option_id=“opt_abcd” corresponds to “Acme Corp”, we output the label). This flattens the data so ChatGPT doesn’t see raw IDs. If needed, we could include an internal identifier for traceability (like also have a custom_fields_idmap mapping field IDs to option IDs that were chosen), but likely not needed for LLM.
created_at and updated_at: timestamps for reference (could be helpful for sorting “what changed”).
If expand=comments was requested: add a comments field which is an array of comment objects, each with id, text, author, and timestamp. The author could be just a name (and we’ll mark if it’s a bot or a specific user).
If expand=subtasks: add subtasks as an array of simplified task objects (id, name, status) for each subtask.
If expand=fields (custom fields) was asked, we might already include custom_fields by default. Or maybe by default we include them anyway since they’re part of a task’s important data in our use case.
Comment Object: Contains id, text, author (name or “ChatGPT” if the integration posts it via some bot identity), and timestamp. We could also include mentions if any in the comment, but likely irrelevant for now.
List Object: For endpoints that return or identify lists (like open-loops), we might have a structure:
list_id, name, and maybe stats like number of open tasks, etc., if needed. But since we have only two main lists, we might not need an endpoint just for list info aside from the schema and mapping.
This normalized schema means the LLM sees friendly names and straightforward structures, avoiding things like nested custom_fields arrays with internal IDs (the ClickUp API raw format) or user IDs that it can’t interpret. It can reason with “status: done” or {"Priority": "High"} easily. Our API essentially translates between the messy ClickUp JSON and a cleaner format. We will document this schema in the OpenAPI spec and ensure examples are available (the Pages site could even show example responses for each endpoint). This helps in fine-tuning the prompt with the LLM so it knows what to expect.
Collaboration Workflow Playbook
To illustrate how this integration will be used day-to-day, we outline common workflows and how ChatGPT + our API work together. The focus is on smooth collaboration: ChatGPT handles the summarizing and proposing actions, while our integration provides the data and the means to execute changes with confirmation.
Morning Digest (09:00 CT): Every morning, ChatGPT can autonomously gather the top open loops so we start the day with an overview. It will call our API using a signed URL like:
GET https://our-worker.domain/v1/open-loops?limit=7&status!=done&exp=1699950000&sig=XYZ...
(This URL is generated by the LLM using the HMAC signing scheme we provided.) The Worker returns up to 7 tasks from “Open Loops” that are not done. Each task includes its status, maybe who it’s waiting on, and due dates. ChatGPT then summarizes these tasks in a list (“You have 5 open loops: Task A (In Progress, due tomorrow), Task B (Waiting on X)…”)
developer.clickup.com
. It might highlight ones due soon or stalled. It can then propose next actions for each – e.g., “Task A is due tomorrow, perhaps reach out to Bob for an update. Task B is waiting on client feedback; maybe check if feedback arrived.” This provides a structured start-of-day plan. If the user agrees, they can ask ChatGPT to go ahead with certain actions (like posting a reminder comment or updating a status). For any such request, ChatGPT will use our API endpoints (with confirmation) – for example, if user says “Mark Task A as priority high and add a note”, ChatGPT might call our POST /v1/task/{id} to update priority and add a comment, which would yield a confirm link for the user to approve.
Awaiting-Verify Sweep: Suppose our “Open Loops” list has tasks in a status like “Awaiting Verification” (meaning the work is done but needs final check). ChatGPT can periodically look for tasks in that status. It could call GET /v1/open-loops?status=awaiting verify and list them out: “These tasks are awaiting verification: X, Y, Z.” It might ask, “Do you want me to mark them as verified and complete them?” If the user says yes (perhaps after reviewing), ChatGPT will invoke our batch verify endpoint. For example, it calls:
POST /v1/tasks/verify   { "tasks": [X_id, Y_id, Z_id], "comment": "✅ Verified via API by ChatGPT" }
The Worker sees this and returns a single confirmation URL like “Verify 3 tasks”. The user clicks it (one click for all), goes through Access if not already logged in, and sees a page: “Confirm marking 3 tasks as Done and adding comment ‘✅ Verified via API’ to each.” On confirm, the Worker updates each task’s status to Done and posts the comment. This might trigger ClickUp webhooks for each task updated, which our system handles (purging them from “open loops” cache). The net effect is that in one sweep, a bunch of tasks get closed out, saving time. ChatGPT can then report “Tasks X, Y, Z have been marked as verified ✔️”.
“What changed today” for Product Pipeline: At day’s end or on demand, ChatGPT can compile a summary of updates in the Product Pipeline (our more long-term project list). It uses an updated_since filter to fetch tasks updated in the last N hours. For example:
GET /v1/tasks?list=product-pipeline&updated_since=2025-08-14T00:00:00Z
(This could retrieve tasks created or modified since the morning.) The Worker might return tasks and possibly include an array of recent comments or status changes if we choose to. ChatGPT can then summarize: “In Product Pipeline today: Task Alpha moved from ‘Proposed’ to ‘In Progress’, Task Beta was commented on by Alice (she provided new specs), and Task Gamma was added.” This is extremely useful for end-of-day handoff or keeping the team informed. If any of those changes require responses (e.g., a comment asking a question), ChatGPT can assist by drafting a reply, which the user can confirm to post via the API.
Quick Add to Product Pipeline: When inspiration strikes or a meeting yields a new feature idea, a team member can tell ChatGPT, “Create a task in the Product Pipeline for … (some feature)”. ChatGPT will gather details via conversation (“What’s the acceptance criteria? Who should be assigned? Priority?”) and then prepare a task creation request. For instance, the user says: “Add a new task: ‘Implement Dark Mode’, assign to Bob, priority Low, with description ‘Add theme toggle for dark mode; must update styling for all components.’” ChatGPT calls our POST /v1/task with that info. The Worker returns a confirm link. The user clicks it, and the task gets created in ClickUp with a nicely formatted description (ChatGPT can even include a template format, like a checklist of acceptance criteria, which it can do in Markdown that ClickUp will render). We have effectively used ChatGPT as an intelligent form for task creation, ensuring required info is there. The new task ID can be returned so ChatGPT might even follow-up with “Task created (ID 123) in Product Pipeline.” We can also have ChatGPT cross-post to Slack or elsewhere if needed, but that’s outside scope for now.
Bulk Import: Imagine we conducted a backlog grooming outside of ClickUp (or migrating from another system) and have 50 tasks to import. Instead of manual entry, we prepare a CSV. Our integration provides a minimal Pages UI (behind Access) where a user can upload the CSV or paste JSON lines. This page might call the POST /v1/tasks/bulk endpoint directly (since the page is Access-authenticated, we trust it). The tasks are queued for creation. ChatGPT can still be part of this loop: after submission, ChatGPT could check the job status via GET /v1/import/{job_id} (maybe the page triggers ChatGPT via some command, or the user asks “How did the import go?”). The response might show that, say, 45 tasks succeeded and 5 failed (with reasons like “assignee email not found” or “duplicate task”). ChatGPT can then present those results to the user in a digest, and even offer to fix issues (like if assignee wasn’t found, ask who it should be, then retry those 5 tasks via another bulk call or individual calls). Thus, ChatGPT becomes an assistant in data migration or bulk editing: monitoring progress and summarizing outcomes. The runbook will include how to handle retries or check the dead-letter queue (if tasks failed due to API issues, etc.).
Other Workflows: Our playbook can grow to include things like:
Status Updates via ChatGPT: e.g., “Move all tasks tagged URGENT to top priority” – ChatGPT fetches those tasks with GET /v1/tasks?tag=URGENT then for each or in batch uses our API to update priority/status (with confirm).
Comment Drafting: “Draft a client update for Task X” – ChatGPT writes a comment and uses /v1/task/X/comment (confirm required) to post it.
Meeting Notes -> Tasks: The team could paste meeting notes and ask ChatGPT to parse out action items and create tasks. ChatGPT could then create multiple tasks (one by one or via bulk if we allowed multiple in one go) each with confirm links. The user confirms each or uses a multi-confirm if we aggregate them.
Each of these scenarios is designed to minimize friction but always keep the human in control. The one-click confirm pattern is central – it’s easy enough that it doesn’t negate the efficiency gains (one click vs manually doing the task), and it ensures confidence that nothing “runs away” on its own.

Entry Point (index.ts): This sets up the Worker’s fetch event listener. We use a router (like Hono or a simple custom switch) to direct requests to the correct handler. For example, a request to /v1/open-loops with method GET triggers handleGetOpenLoops(request) in routes.ts, whereas a POST to /v1/task triggers handleCreateTask(request). We’ll also parse query parameters and JSON bodies here. We include middleware-like steps: e.g., verify HMAC signature for GET requests (if required), and verify Access JWT for any confirm or admin endpoints. ClickUp API Module (clickup.ts): Encapsulates direct HTTP calls to ClickUp’s endpoints. For instance, it will have functions like getTasks(listId, filters), createTask(listId, payload), updateTask(taskId, payload), addComment(taskId, text), etc. Each function constructs the proper URL (https://api.clickup.com/api/v2/...), sets the Authorization header with our token, and performs fetch. We handle response parsing and error detection here. If a call returns 429 or a 5xx error, this module could implement a retry with delay (especially for rate limits, we can coordinate with DO if needed). By isolating this, if ClickUp changes an endpoint or if we add OAuth flows, we update in one place. We also map certain errors to our own error codes (for instance, if ClickUp returns a 404 for a task not found, we might throw a NotFoundError that our handlers catch and return a cleaner message). Signing Utility (sign.ts): Provides generateSignedUrl(path, params) and verifySignature(request) functions. It will manage our secret keys (from environment). For signing, it takes a path and query params object, appends exp (expiry) and kid, and computes sig. For verification, it checks those fields. This will be used in handlers when outputting links (for ChatGPT to call or user to click). Auth (auth.ts): Contains the logic to validate the Access JWT. Likely a function verifyAccessJWT(request) that returns the decoded token or throws an error. It will fetch our Cloudflare Access JWKS on first run (or be populated via Wrangler secrets with the public key to avoid needing to fetch at runtime). We’ll enforce that token.aud matches our app’s AUD, and perhaps that email claim ends with our domain (just an extra check if needed). We also could provide helper to extract the user email for logging (for audit logs). Data Cache (dataCache.ts): Wrapper around the KV namespace binding (say we bind METRICRAFT_KV). It might have methods like getCache(key) and setCache(key, value, ttl), plus perhaps listCache(prefix) or deleteCache(key) if needed. It could also interact with the DO: e.g., a method invalidateCache(listId) that calls the DO to do a coordinated invalidation (the DO could then call back to KV to delete keys or bump versions). We may integrate versioning here: e.g., getCacheVersion(listId) stored in KV, and include that in keys. Durable Object (CacheCoordinator.ts): Implements the Durable Object class that Cloudflare Workers will instantiate (we define it in wrangler.toml). It has an internal storage (we can persist some state if needed, like counters or last invalidation times). This DO likely exposes methods via stub.fetch() or stub.send() (if we use DO stub to send messages) such as:
invalidate(listId) – increments a version or flags the cache as stale for that list.
registerWebhookEvent(event) – maybe to handle a webhook (though we’re mostly using queue for webhooks, but we could involve DO to throttle bursts of events).
checkRateLimit() – to see if we should delay a request (though doing this for every request might introduce latency; we could also just use it for write operations or heavy bursts).
useIdempotency(key) – to record an operation key and return if it’s already seen.
The DO can schedule itself with Alarms if we needed periodic tasks (not heavily needed here except maybe to expire old idempotency keys after 24h, though KV TTL can handle that). Queue Consumers (webhookConsumer.ts, bulkImportConsumer.ts): These are separate Worker scripts that will be triggered by queue messages. They have access to the same modules (we can reuse code by sharing some library functions, or for simplicity incorporate minimal logic):
webhookConsumer.ts: runs onQueue(batch, env, ctx) style (depending on CF Workers queue API). It will loop through events in the batch, verify their signature using WEBHOOK_SECRET (provided in env), then for each valid event call the DO’s invalidate for the affected list/task. If the event is something like taskCommentPosted, we might not need to invalidate task data unless we choose to cache comments; but we might eventually use such events to notify the user through ChatGPT (future feature: push notifications).
bulkImportConsumer.ts: picks up tasks to create from the queue. Possibly the producer already put tasks with all needed info in the queue messages. It will call clickup.createTask for each, and update the job status in KV/DO. If a task creation fails for a specific reason, record that in the status. Use Idempotency-Key if provided per task or a deterministic one per task content to avoid duplicates on retry. Ensure to respect rate limits (maybe a small delay every few tasks if needed, or rely on token bucket concept via DO – e.g., ask DO if it can proceed).
Both consumers, after processing, will delete messages from the queue. If something is unprocessable (e.g., bad payload), they might send to a dead-letter queue or log an error.
Pages (Confirm & Import): We use Cloudflare Pages (since Workers and Pages can share the same domain with different routes, or a separate domain). Our confirm.html will be a simple page that likely uses a query param or state token to identify the pending action. One approach: when our Worker receives a POST /v1/task and returns confirm_url with a token, we also stash the original request payload in KV keyed by that token (with short TTL). The confirm page, when loaded with that token, calls (via JavaScript fetch or form submission) an endpoint like /v1/confirm?token=XYZ. The Worker then retrieves the payload from KV, re-verifies nothing changed (and that the token is valid), then performs the action (create task, etc.), and returns HTML or JSON indicating success which the page displays (“Task created!”). We could also make the confirm page perform a POST directly (like a form containing the signed payload) to a Worker endpoint. Simpler: confirm page loads, user clicks "Yes", that triggers a JS which does fetch('/v1/confirm?token=XYZ', { method: 'POST' }) – the Worker knows what to do via token.
The confirm.html should also have a cancel button (just in case) that maybe simply invalidates the token or informs the user nothing happened.
We’ll secure that the confirm endpoint also requires Access JWT (so someone cannot just hit it with a token without being logged in).
After confirmation, the page can show a success message and maybe a link “View task in ClickUp” (we have the task ID now).
The import.html page will let a user choose a file. We can use a library or just HTML5 File API to read it, parse into JSON, display a preview table, then on submit, call our API with the items. Since this is a bit heavy for ChatGPT context, it’s mainly for manual use. It will also poll the import/{job_id} and update the UI (e.g., a progress bar or “X of Y tasks created.”). Both confirm and import pages are deliberately minimal in styling (maybe a simple Tailwind or Cloudflare’s style) – we just need them functional for our team. OpenAPI Spec (openapi.yaml): We will draft a complete OpenAPI 3.1 spec describing every endpoint, its params, and schemas for request and response. This is useful for documentation and also if we or others want to auto-generate clients or Postman collections. We’ll include examples for each operation. For instance, GET /v1/open-loops example response, POST /v1/task example request (and example confirm preview response), etc. Security schemes in the spec might note that no auth is needed for signed URL (or rather, the HMAC is our auth), and a separate scheme for the Access JWT on the confirm endpoints. We can’t really show the HMAC in OpenAPI easily; we’ll just document how the signing works in descriptions. Postman Collection: Using the OpenAPI, we can generate a Postman collection or just manually create one. It will be mainly for developer testing (since ChatGPT doesn’t use Postman). It’s handy for us to run some queries against the Worker (with a way to supply a valid signature or bypass auth for local testing). We can include pre-request scripts in Postman that generate the signature given our known dev key (to simulate ChatGPT’s calls). The collection will also include environment variables for endpoints, tokens, etc. Unit Tests: We’ll include some basic tests (if we have time) for critical functions. For example, tests for sign.ts to ensure a known key produces expected signature and the verify logic catches tampered input. Tests for auth.ts can use a sample JWT (decoded with our public key) to check validation logic. Possibly test the CacheCoordinator DO logic in isolation (Cloudflare provides a DO testing framework or one can simulate it). These ensure our core is solid. For integration testing, we could use Wrangler dev or a staging deployment and simulate sequences (but those would be more like end-to-end tests not easy to include in repo, so primarily manual testing via Postman and actual ChatGPT session will prove it out).
Deployment, Testing, and Runbook
We will deploy this integration in Cloudflare’s environment and provide guidance for both production deployment and local testing:
Cloudflare Setup: In the Cloudflare dashboard (or via Wrangler CLI), we’ll create:
A Workers KV Namespace (e.g., METRICRAFT_KV) for caching and tokens.
A Durable Object namespace for CacheCoordinator (Wrangler config will handle creation).
Two Queues: one for clickup_webhooks and one for bulk_task_import. We’ll attach the consumer scripts accordingly.
A Cloudflare Access application for our domain (or route) – e.g., protect https://ourapp.dev/confirm* and /import* with Access. We’ll set allowed emails (our team’s) and integrate Google SSO. We note the Audience (AUD) tag given by Access to verify JWTs.
Environment Variables / Secrets: Using Wrangler, set the ClickUp API token (CLICKUP_TOKEN), initial HMAC key(s) (HMAC_KEY_primary etc.), and any other secret (like WEBHOOK_VERIFICATION_TOKEN if needed). Wrangler makes it easy: wrangler secret put CLICKUP_TOKEN.
Set up appropriate routes: e.g., our Worker can be deployed to api.metricraft.example domain or as a Worker with a specific route path. Cloudflare Pages (if on a different domain, say metricraft.pages.dev) might be used for UI, but we can also serve UI from Worker if simpler. Probably easier: use Pages for static files (confirm and import HTML/JS) and Worker for API. Cloudflare allows binding Workers to Pages too (Functions), but here separate is fine.
Local Testing: During development, we’ll use wrangler dev which can simulate the Worker on localhost and even provide a tunnel for webhooks. Steps:
Use wrangler dev --local --persist to run the Worker and DO locally. (If using local mode, DO and KV operations can be persisted for testing).
For testing signed URLs, the developer can use the signing utility or Postman pre-scripts to generate them. We might include a small Node.js script in repo to generate a test signed URL for a given endpoint and secret (useful to quickly open in browser and see the response).
Testing webhooks: because webhooks from ClickUp need to reach our dev environment, we could use a tool like cloudflared tunnel or ngrok to expose the local dev Worker. Alternatively, set wrangler dev --remote which actually deploys to Cloudflare in a preview mode (so it has a public URL which we could give to ClickUp temporarily). The runbook suggests using something like smee.io
developer.clickup.com
 for webhook testing if needed, but Cloudflare’s ability to run dev on their edge is handy.
The developer can simulate events by calling the internal functions or hitting an endpoint manually. We’ll likely test create task flow entirely locally first (with a real ClickUp token pointing to a test ClickUp list to avoid messing prod data).
We also ensure that our code handles real scenarios (like creating a task with a dropdown field requires fetching the field options first – our code should handle caching those or fetching on demand).
Production Deployment: Once tested, wrangler deploy (or wrangler publish) will push the Worker, DO, and consumer scripts to Cloudflare. We will ensure environment bindings in wrangler.toml are correctly set for production (IDs for KV, DO, etc., which Wrangler often manages automatically). We’ll deploy to a custom domain or workers.dev subdomain as decided. Webhooks in ClickUp will be updated to point to the production URL (and we’ll provide a script or command in runbook to register them, e.g., via our API or manually using the ClickUp API Reference with our token).
We’ll maintain separate environments for dev and prod (Wrangler supports env.dev, env.production sections). So we can have a dev Worker with perhaps a different prefix or domain that uses a ClickUp sandbox workspace or just a separate list for safe testing.
The runbook will specify how to cut over from dev to prod, how to update DNS or routes if needed, and how to verify it’s working (e.g., test retrieving a task from prod environment and see if it matches real data).
Webhooks Maintenance: ClickUp webhooks don’t expire but if our token changes or we suspect issues, we may need to re-register. The runbook will include instructions using our API:
e.g., call DELETE /v1/webhooks/{id} to remove outdated ones (we could implement that if needed),
and a script to call ClickUp’s Create Webhook for each list with the new endpoint URL and secret. We can automate this in our system or just document using their API console with our token.
We’ll also set up in ClickUp UI a way to monitor webhook health; and consider an alert if our Worker misses an acknowledgement (ClickUp’s webhook health endpoint can show if they’re failing).
Incident Response & Rollback: In case something goes wrong (e.g., an API bug spams tasks or a confirm bypass is found), we can immediately disable the integration by:
Pausing the Worker (Cloudflare allows toggling a Worker off or removing routes).
Revoking the ClickUp token (regenerate it on ClickUp, invalidating the old).
This will stop all automation. The runbook should mention this as an emergency step.
For partial rollbacks (like if a bug created 100 duplicate tasks), we rely on ClickUp’s UI or bulk delete to fix data, but our audit logs would help identify what happened.
Because writes are human-confirmed, the chance of large-scale accidental damage is low, but it’s good to have contingency.
Token Rotation: If we stick with personal token, it’s manual (Click avatar > regenerate token). That invalidates old token immediately (personal tokens never expire otherwise). We should schedule to rotate to OAuth app when feasible, but if not, at least treat the token like password (only in secrets, rotate if suspicion of leak). The runbook will note: update secret in Cloudflare, redeploy Worker. There might be a few seconds downtime if an API call hits in between with old token (rare, can schedule off-hours). Because the token is only in Worker memory, rotating should be seamless.
Monitoring Usage: We will keep an eye on Cloudflare Worker metrics (invocations, CPU time) to ensure our design is efficient (most calls should be quick, caching helps; DO usage is minimal per action). Also monitor ClickUp API usage (they don’t have a live dashboard, but we can infer from our logs if nearing 100/min). If needed, increase plan or optimize calls.
Open Source Consideration: Our design favors generality (the endpoints could work for any list if allowed) and security. If we choose to open source, we’ll remove any hardcoded IDs and instead allow configuration of allowed lists, etc. The repository will contain instructions for others to deploy their own (they’d need a Cloudflare account and a ClickUp token or to register an OAuth app). We will ensure no sensitive data is in the repo (just placeholders in config). Possibly we provide a template wrangler.toml where they put their IDs and tokens via secrets.
ChatGPT Connector (MCP) Plans: While our initial solution uses direct API calls via signed URLs and confirm links, we’re prepared to integrate with OpenAI’s ChatGPT Connectors (if/when available widely). This could mean hosting an API with some manifest so that ChatGPT can treat it as a plugin. Because we already have an OpenAPI spec, we can likely feed that into the connector registration (OpenAI plugins use OpenAPI JSON and an authentication scheme – in our case auth is custom (HMAC) plus Access for writes, which might not directly map, but we can handle it by implementing the plugin server as below in Option B/C). The runbook will note steps to create a plugin manifest, and how to restrict its use (maybe only for our org initially).
Now, let’s analyze the productization options and our recommendation.
Productization Options (A, B, C) and Recommendation
We see three viable paths to productize this integration beyond our internal use, each with pros and cons: Option A – Cloudflare Worker API (Private or Open Source): Our current approach. We treat the integration as a private API service. We can open source the code so others can deploy it, but each user/team would host their own Worker (with their ClickUp credentials). Distribution would be via the code repository; interested users set it up manually. There’s no direct ChatGPT “store” listing – users would interact with it by copying signed URLs from ChatGPT’s responses (as we plan to do), or potentially by adding our domain to ChatGPT’s browsing (if allowed). We could also maintain it just for Metricraft.
Security: Very high, as secrets never leave our control. We are not sharing our ClickUp data with any third-party service beyond OpenAI (which only sees processed data we allow). If open-sourced, others would use their own tokens. No centralized storage of others’ tokens – each user deploys their own instance (multi-tenant not built in by default, avoiding that complexity and risk).
Latency: Hitting our Cloudflare Worker from ChatGPT is fast (<100ms usually) due to Cloudflare’s global edge and caching. ChatGPT would either use its browsing functionality or plugin system to call our API. As long as it can reach the URL, performance is good (Cloudflare has excellent uptime and scalability).
Ops Complexity: Moderate-low. We manage one Worker and its resources. Cloudflare handles scaling. We do need to maintain it (apply updates, monitor usage) but no additional infrastructure. If open source, there’s overhead of community support and docs. No need to comply with OpenAI plugin hosting requirements (like hosting in a specific environment).
Multi-tenant strategy: Initially N/A (single-tenant Metricraft). If open-sourced, each user is isolated in their own deployment. To truly offer it as a service to multiple users from one deployment, we’d have to implement user accounts, OAuth per user, database for tokens, etc. That would turn it into a bigger product and require careful segmentation of data. Option A doesn’t easily allow one shared service for all – it’s more a toolkit.
Distribution: Not directly in ChatGPT’s plugin store, so less discoverable. If open-sourced, tech-savvy users could deploy easily (especially since Cloudflare Workers offers a free tier, etc.). We could write a guide or even a Terraform script to streamline deployment.
Cloudflare-first alignment: Excellent. It showcases Cloudflare tech (Workers, DO, KV, Queues) and doesn’t rely on anything else. We avoid external cloud servers entirely. This resonates with our preference and could be a good public example if we publish it.
Option B – ChatGPT Connector via MCP (Managed Connector Platform): In this scenario, we develop an integration specifically for ChatGPT’s plugin/connector system. OpenAI’s “Connectors” (if referring to the recently announced feature in 2025) likely allow us to host an API that ChatGPT can call as tools, with OpenAI handling authentication and user consent. Possibly, OpenAI would let users connect their ClickUp account via OAuth through ChatGPT, storing the token on their side, and then ChatGPT calls our connector when needed. We’d essentially implement an MCP server that acts as a middleman: ChatGPT calls “create_task” function with parameters, our server (hosted by us or OpenAI) uses stored credentials to call ClickUp and returns result.
Security: Here, secrets (user tokens) might live on OpenAI’s side or our connector backend. If OpenAI handles OAuth, tokens could be stored in their encrypted store and passed when calling our API. Alternatively, our connector could manage tokens for each user, which means multi-tenant handling on our side (we’d need a database to store tokens keyed by some user ID from ChatGPT, encryption at rest, etc.). This introduces more risk – we’d be holding potentially many users’ tokens if the connector is public. We’d have to implement robust security around that. The advantage is the user doesn’t manually manage tokens, it’s through a standardized consent flow.
Latency: Could be slightly higher if ChatGPT calls our connector which then calls Cloudflare Worker or ClickUp. Possibly we could deploy the connector on Cloudflare as well (maybe even reuse the Worker with an updated interface). If OpenAI hosts parts of it, not sure. But likely, more hops and multi-tenant checks means a bit more delay. Still, should be seconds at most, which is fine for chat.
Ops Complexity: Higher. We’d need to follow OpenAI’s Connector specs, maintain compatibility, and possibly handle a review process to get listed. We might need to run a persistent service if the connector can’t be purely serverless (but we could adapt our Worker to handle multiple tokens by passing a user identifier from ChatGPT, effectively making our Worker multi-tenant). Logging and monitoring multi-user usage would be more complex. Also, support requests from users if something doesn’t work.
Multi-tenant strategy: This is built for it – we’d have to implement multi-tenant from the start. Likely using ClickUp OAuth for each user. That’s a significant addition: implementing the OAuth redirect and token exchange either in the Worker or another environment. Cloudflare Workers can handle OAuth flows (with some complexity around callback URLs, but doable using Durable Objects to store pending state). We might need a small database (or KV) to map ChatGPT user to their workspace token. Also, token refresh if they start expiring in future.
Distribution: Potentially excellent – we could be one of the first ClickUp integrations on ChatGPT, visible in whatever store or UI ChatGPT provides, meaning a broader user base and recognition for Metricraft if we brand it. Users can just “enable” it in ChatGPT and connect their account, then converse naturally. This has product marketing appeal.
Cloudflare alignment: If we implement the connector server as our existing Cloudflare Worker (just enhanced), we still are Cloudflare-first. However, some of OpenAI’s connector ecosystem might expect certain hosting or might impose some limitations that we need to verify. But we’d strive to reuse as much as possible (our Worker can expose OpenAPI and the plugin manifest).
One challenge: The confirm flow – ChatGPT Connectors ideally allow the model to call functions and get immediate results. The human confirmation pattern is not standard for plugins (plugins usually execute immediately once user consents to enabling the plugin). We might tweak the flow for a published connector: maybe initial version for public use would not require manual confirmation for certain safe actions (since general users might find that too cumbersome). We’d rely on narrower scopes or permissions. For instance, if a user installs the “ClickUp Connector”, they presumably trust ChatGPT to manage tasks, so we might allow direct writes for them (maybe with a configurable toggle). This is a big difference – our internal use demands high safety, but a public plugin might assume user consent covers it. We could still include a safeguard (like asking “Are you sure I should complete task X?” in the chat). This would need UX refinement in a public setting.
Option C – Hybrid (Worker + Thin MCP Facade): This combines the best of both: we keep our Cloudflare Worker as the core (with all the logic, caching, security checks), and implement a minimal Connector facade that conforms to ChatGPT’s requirements but mostly just proxies requests to the Worker. Essentially:
We adapt our OpenAPI spec to a format suitable for ChatGPT’s function calling. Possibly define functions like list_open_loops(status_exclude="done", limit=7), create_task(list, title, ...), etc., in a manifest. The connector server (which could be the same Worker or another) simply receives function call from ChatGPT, then internally calls our Worker endpoints (could be a direct function call if same code or an HTTP call if separate). Because it’s our code, we enforce the same allow-lists.
For authentication: Instead of HMAC signed URLs (which might not be needed if ChatGPT’s plugin system passes auth differently), we could have ChatGPT include an auth header (like an access token representing the user) when calling our connector API. This token could be a JWT we issue after the user does OAuth. Or if OpenAI provides a user-specific auth mechanism (some plugins use OAuth where ChatGPT stores the token and calls your API with an Authorization Bearer token that you verify), we can integrate that. Cloudflare Worker can easily handle verifying a Bearer token from ChatGPT and mapping to the user’s ClickUp token (we might store mapping in KV).
Security: Still strong because our Worker does the heavy lifting and we keep secrets at our end. The main difference is we’d need to store per-user ClickUp tokens safely (which means encrypting them at rest in KV or DO). We might leverage Cloudflare DO storage for this (DO storage is encrypted at rest by CF; we could add an encryption layer ourselves if paranoid). Also, if public, we’d implement usage quotas or abuse monitoring (we don’t want someone enabling the plugin and then our free Worker gets hammered by thousands of users; if it took off, we’d likely coordinate with Cloudflare for capacity or move to enterprise plan).
Latency: Slight overhead if the facade is separate, but we could actually merge them: make the Worker detect if it’s being called as a plugin (with a certain header) and then allow direct action. Or run the plugin server logic as a Cloudflare Pages Function or another Worker that just sanitizes inputs then calls the main Worker (which is somewhat redundant). Perhaps simplest: unify them.
Ops: More complex than A, but we avoid reinventing logic for B from scratch – we reuse our robust Worker. We would need to add OAuth user flows: e.g., an endpoint /oauth/callback to receive ClickUp’s auth code for a user and store their token, which means hosting a small webpage for the OAuth consent process (we could repurpose Pages site or even do it within ChatGPT’s UI if they allow popping a window). This is doable with moderate effort.
Distribution: Great, through ChatGPT plugin directory, with our branding. Also, we still have the internal Worker interface for other uses (maybe future integrations directly from Slack or other automation can also call our Worker’s API).
Recommendation: Start with Option A (Worker-only) for immediate needs and stability, and design the system in a way that is extensible to Option C (Hybrid). The Worker-only approach gets our team using the integration right away without worrying about multi-user complexity. It also acts as a proving ground for our API design and security; any kinks can be worked out with a small user base (us). We will keep an eye on ChatGPT’s connector platform maturity. As it stabilizes, we can implement the OAuth multi-tenant features in our Worker and register a ChatGPT Connector. The hybrid approach lets us maintain one codebase: the Worker remains the core service, and the “plugin” is essentially configuration (OpenAPI manifest + some user auth flows) on top of it. We prefer this over Option B because it avoids splitting logic and keeps Cloudflare in the loop (Option B might tempt moving logic into OpenAI functions or an AWS Lambda, which we don’t need). It also means if connectors have any downtime or changes, our core still functions for us or any self-hosted users. For open-sourcing, Option A with good documentation can already be valuable to other devs (they can deploy their own worker). We can later provide an official Connector (Option C) for non-technical users to simply activate in ChatGPT. Security & Trust Consideration for Public: If we do Option C, we’ll need to possibly relax the human-confirm requirement to make it user-friendly. A middle ground could be: by default, the plugin warns the user in chat and asks for confirmation (“Shall I go ahead and mark task X as done?”) and the user says “Yes” in chat, which is captured as consent, then the plugin executes without an extra webpage click. That way, the conversation handles confirmation. This is an acceptable flow in ChatGPT as long as the plugin doesn’t do things without user prompt. Since our integration will only act when ChatGPT is explicitly instructed or asks and gets approval, it should be fine. We’d still keep dangerous operations limited. Next Milestones:
Deploy & Internal Testing (Option A): Get the Worker running with our Metricraft workspace. Test the morning digest, task create, comment, status change flows with actual data. Fine-tune the prompt style ChatGPT should use (maybe add some custom instructions for how it presents confirm links or summarization).
Documentation & Open Source Release: Clean up any hardcoded IDs (move to config), write a guide in the README for deploying your own, and publish the repo on GitHub (if management agrees). Possibly prepare a blog post or at least internal announcement about it.
Monitor Usage & Performance: Use it for a few weeks. Note how ChatGPT interacts – we might adjust the API or prompt wording if the LLM misunderstands something (e.g., we might need to tweak how it asks for confirmation).
Implement OAuth Multi-tenant (if planning connector): This means creating a ClickUp OAuth app (which we can do now actually, as owners). The scopes aren’t granular
docs.nango.dev
, but we can limit to specific endpoints by policy. Implement storing multiple tokens keyed by user. This could be done gradually – maybe have a branch for connector version.
Connector Manifest & Testing (Option C): Once OpenAI opens Connector submissions (possibly requiring a review and domain verification), prepare the .well-known/ai-plugin.json and OpenAPI JSON for our API, and test it with ChatGPT in developer mode. Ensure the user OAuth flow works – ChatGPT likely handles initiating the OAuth (redirects user to ClickUp, then gets a token and calls our API with it). We’ll adapt our endpoints to accept a Bearer token (the user-specific one) in place of our single token. This might involve putting token in Authorization header to ClickUp (we can dynamically do that). We keep personal token as fallback for our own use.
Publish Connector (Option C) Publicly: Go through the listing process. This might involve hardening everything, adding pricing info (if any, but we likely offer it free or require users to bring their own CF Worker – we have to decide if we run a free service for the world or not; maybe limited free, with option to self-host for heavy use).
Ongoing Improvements: Based on user feedback, add features (maybe support more ClickUp features like Checklist items, or supporting multiple lists beyond the two if user configures it). Also, update for any API v3 changes by ClickUp, etc.
In summary, Option A now, aiming for Option C eventually provides the best mix of immediate value and future potential. This phased approach ensures we don’t over-engineer early on, and we maintain our Cloudflare-first, security-first principles throughout.
By following this design and plan, we will have a functioning integration that makes our ClickUp tasks part of ChatGPT’s conversational workflow, boosting our productivity while safeguarding our data. The delivered artifacts – from the executive playbook (for our ops team to know how to use ChatGPT with this) to the technical architecture and code – set a strong foundation for Metricraft’s move toward intelligent process automation.
